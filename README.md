# playlistAutomator
This is a terminal based application that curates a Spotify playlist based on a userâ€™s liked videos on YouTube.
Worked with the YouTube Web API to retrieve the liked videos playlist for a logged in user. Sent requests to the Spotify
Web API to create playlists and fill them with songs from the YouTube liked playlist.
